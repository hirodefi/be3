# Be³ Network  
**Be here. Be free. Be gone.**

Aim: Proof of Presence.
A network that breathes when you do.  
Every open app is a heartbeat 
every moment of awareness fuels the chain.

No mining farms. No background loops.  Only presence → energy → release.

Core Idea  
When you open Be³, you warm the network.  
Your device becomes a living node 
validating vibes, routing ghosts, witnessing dissolutions.  
Close it, and it dissolves — leaving only proof you were real.

Not Proof of Work. Not Proof of Stake. Proof of Presence.

Essence  
Zero servers. Zero surveillance.  
Lightweight mesh - local, ephemeral, self-erasing.  
Tokens born from time spent alive: *BREATHS* or *SPARKS*.  
Earned by presence, decayed by time, capped by meaning.

Philosophy  
Be³ is not social media. It’s a social moment.  
It remembers nothing except that we were here —  
together — for a while.


# Vibing the Be³ Manifesto:

# Be³  
**Be here. Be free. Be gone.**

## The Soul  
### The energy of the digital campfire  

We don’t need 1,000 followers — just a few souls who see us.  
We don’t need permanent records — we need permission to change.  
We don’t need viral moments — we need real ones.  

Be³ is a return to presence.  
A circle of energy in a cold feed-driven world.  
When the fire fades, the only thing that remains is the energy, not the ashes.

---

## The Brain  
### Local intelligence that enhances — never harvests  

Every device carries a small ghost — a local AI companion that lives, learns, and forgets with you.  

**The Ghost**  
- Translates emotion into color, sound, and shape  
- Suggests creative quests for your circle  
- Remixes what you all create into something new  
- Learns your tone, but forgets when you do  

No cloud. No collection. No training on your data.  
The Ghost is presence-aware, not data-hungry.

---

## The Skeleton  
### Architecture that actually protects you  

**Your phone = your server**  
**Your data = your control**  
**Your identity = your keys**

**Structure**  
- Identity: Ephemeral DIDs — new cryptographic self every session  
- Network: zk-DAG mesh — phones link directly, no central nodes  
- Storage: Encrypted fragments across circle members’ devices  
- Protocol: Matrix + IPFS backbone — proven, distributed  
- Consensus: Proof-of-Presence — you can’t fake being here  
- Deletion: zk-verified proof of erasure — gone means gone  

When a Circle ends, the Skeleton dissolves.  
What’s left? Nothing but proof that nothing remains.

---

## The Heart  
### Three rhythms of connection  

**Beat 1: Spark — fleeting (hours)**  
An instant alignment with strangers.  
No usernames. No traces. Just feeling → gone.  

**Beat 2: Circle — alive (days / weeks)**  
Your small tribe of 5–15.  
Shared canvas, sounds, and quests.  
A digital campfire that burns bright, then fades.  

**Beat 3: Constellation — enduring (earned)**  
Souls you’ve circled with three times.  
A private, encrypted channel that stays.  
Your only persistent space — proof that impermanence can build meaning.

---

## The Breath  
### Energy as presence. Mining as mindfulness.  

Every open Be³ app is a heartbeat in the network.  
No servers. No rigs. No farms.  
Just living nodes — people breathing together through devices.  

When you open Be³, you warm the fire for others.  
When you close it, the fire rests.  
No hidden background loops. No silent consumption.  
Only awareness, only participation.  

While active, your device becomes a **Warm Node** that:  
- Validates vibes between peers  
- Holds temporary encrypted fragments  
- Routes Portal Hour connections  
- Witnesses proper Circle dissolutions  

**The Breathchain**  
Not a permanent ledger — temporary proofs that expire after 24 hours.  
Each “breath” confirms you were here, you were real, you helped others be free.  
Then it dissolves, leaving only energy.  

**Sparks — Proof of energy**  
- 1 spark / minute while in a Circle  
- 0.1 spark / minute while present  
- 10 sparks for witnessing dissolution  
- 100 sparks for forming a Constellation  

Sparks aren’t money. They can’t be traded or sold.  
They decay (half-life: 30 days), capped at 10,000.  
They are weight in the network — priority, resonance, voice.  

**Resource use**  
CPU <1% | Storage <50 MB | Battery <0.5% / hr | Network <1 MB / hr  

You never see stats. Just a gentle glow:  
> “You’ve kept the fire warm for 33 hours.”

## The Pure  
### Aligned incentives. Honest model.  

“No memory. No metrics. No masters.”  

No ads — there’s nothing to sell.  
No algorithm — there’s nothing to optimize.  
No investors — there’s nothing to extract.  
No vanity — there’s nothing to prove.  

Community-funded: coffee-jar economy — €2 / month if moved.  
Open-source: the code belongs to everyone.  
Transparent: decisions visible, updates voted.  
Sustainable: growth isn’t the goal — integrity is.  

Be³’s purity isn’t moral; it’s structural.  
It can’t betray you — the math won’t let it.

## The Experience  

**Opening Be³**  
“How do you feel?”  
A soft gradient swells under your touch.  
You choose three vibes — a color, a sound, an image.  
Your Ghost awakens.  

Circles appear like constellations:  
- Dawn Chorus — 3 here now  
- Midnight Oil — 7 here now  

Inside, no usernames — only colors and presence.  
No posts — just play.  

Today’s quest: *“Show each other the texture of quiet.”*  
You share fragments. The Ghost weaves them together.  
In five days, this Circle dissolves.  
Each keeps one spark; the rest returns to the void.  

**The Portal**  
Once a month, walls fade for one hour.  
You drift between worlds as a ghost.  
Then it closes — leaving only echoes.

---

## The Promise  

Be³ doesn’t want your data.  
Be³ doesn’t want your attention.  
Be³ doesn’t want you to perform.  

It only wants you to:  
- Be here — fully present with a few others  
- Be free — to explore without consequence  
- Be gone — to leave without a trace

---

## The Beginning  

The first Circle forms when 333 people say:  
> “I want to exist without being watched.”  
> “I want to connect without performing.”  
> “I want to be free to become.”  

At midnight on a new moon, they gather.  
They light the first digital fire.  
It lasts three days.  
Then it’s gone.  
But the energy remains.

## Be³  
It has a Soul.  
It has a Brain.  
It has a Skeleton.  
It has a Heart.  
It has a Breath.  
It is Pure.  

**Be here. Be free. Be gone.**
